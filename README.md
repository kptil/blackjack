# Blackjack
## Description
This project implements a simplified version of the game blackjack. A card is dealt to the player automatically. The player then chooses to get another card or hold his/her hand. If the player chooses to get another card, another card is dealt and added to the player's hand. If the player's hand equals 21, the player wins. If the player's hand exceeds 21, the player loses. If neither is true, play continues. If the user chooses to hold his/her hand, the dealer is dealt the equivalent of two cards at once. The dealer's hand is then evaluated to see if it equals or exceeds 21. If neither is true, both hands are below 21, and the highest hand wins.

## Authorship
I completed this project in Spring 2021 for a programming class at the University of Florida. I wrote the code in Blackjack.java. The code in P1Random.java was provided by the instructor as helper code.
